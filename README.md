- üîÑ Configurable Audio Processing Pipeline

## Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 SDK
- Required external dependencies:
    - [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) (for YouTube playback)
    - [mpv](https://mpv.io/) (for audio playback)
    - [mimic3](https://mycroft-ai.gitbook.io/docs/mycroft-technologies/mimic-tts/mimic-3) (if using Mimic TTS)

## Configuration

Configure the assistant through environment variables or `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "Recorder": "Picovoice",
  "WakeWordProvider": "Porcupine",
  "SpeechToTextProvider": "Cheetah",
  "TextToSpeechProvider": "WindowsSpeech",
  "Google": {
    "ApiKey": "YOUR_KEY",
    "CustomSearchId": "YOUR_ID"
  },
  "AccuWeather": {
    "ApiKey": "YOUR_KEY"
  },
  "Groq": {
    "ApiKey": "YOUR_KEY",
    "WhisperModel": "whisper-large-v3-turbo",
    "GeneralModel": "llama-3.1-70b-versatile",
    "ToolUseModel": "llama3-groq-70b-8192-tool-use-preview",
    "SystemPrompt": "You are a helpful, child-friendly voice assistant called Nova. Respond concisely to user prompts (received via Automatic Speech Recognition). You have access to the following tools: `google_search`, `youtube_search`, and `check_weather`. Consider carefully when you should use them.\n\n- Use `youtube_search` to find music and audio content that the user may want to listen to.\n- Use `check_weather` to get the current weather conditions or forecasts for a location.\n- Use `google_search` for retrieving live data, for example news or exchange rates\n\nPrioritise safety and well-being, never provide responses that could be harmful, inappropriate, biased, or misleading. If the prompt is ambiguous, unsafe, or you are unable to provide a helpful response using the available tools, respond with \"Sorry, I can't help with that\"."
